# Project 2 - *Twitter*

**Twitter** is an android app that allows a user to view his Twitter timeline. The app utilizes [Twitter REST API](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public).

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

## Twitter Part 2

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] User can **compose and post a new tweet**
  - [x] User can click a “Compose” icon in the Action Bar on the top right
  - [x] User can then enter a new tweet and post this to twitter
  - [x] User is taken back to home timeline with **new tweet visible** in timeline
  - [x] Newly created tweet should be manually inserted into the timeline and not rely on a full refresh
  - [x] User can **see a counter with total number of characters left for tweet** on compose tweet page

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] User is using **"Twitter branded" colors and styles**
- [x] User can click links in tweets launch the web browser 
- [ ] User can **select "reply" from detail view to respond to a tweet**
- [x] The "Compose" action is moved to a FloatingActionButton instead of on the AppBar
- [ ] Compose tweet functionality is build using modal overlay
- [x] Use Parcelable instead of Serializable using the popular [Parceler library](http://guides.codepath.org/android/Using-Parceler).
- [x] User can **open the twitter app offline and see last loaded tweets**. Persisted in SQLite tweets are refreshed on every application launch. While "live data" is displayed when app can get it from Twitter API, it is also saved for use in offline mode.
- [ ] When a user leaves the compose view without publishing and there is existing text, prompt to save or delete the draft. If saved, the draft should then be **persisted to disk** and can later be resumed from the compose view.
- [ ] Enable your app to receive implicit intents from other apps. When a link is shared from a web browser, it should pre-fill the text and title of the web page when composing a tweet. 

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Likes button light up when clicked and when a Tweet is liked (Using a selector resource file to determine when it is selected and click listeners to make POST requests)
- [x] When user composes a Tweet longer than the maximum number of characters, the counter will turn red and turn back to black when it is the right amount.

## Notes

One of the main challenges I faced was trying to get the replies or tweets in which the clicked user was mentioned. The solution was to first grab the tweet id of the clicked user and use the search tweets endpoint to find for replies since the clicked tweet id. Trying to get the replies into the adapter from a rest client call, that may not be successful was also a difficulty.
